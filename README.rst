This GitHub Repo was created for developing a template through a POC (Proof of Concept) of ReadtheDocs functionality for Hyperledger Projects. 
Linked up Github with ReadtheDocs so that a Pull Request syncs to the documentation page
ReStructured Text Syntax was utilized to test image-based button linking 

See my POC Tutorial here: 

https://read-the-docs-sphinx-project.readthedocs.io/en/latest/?

Hyperledger documentation on ReadtheDocs is populated by files from the various Hyperledger project GitHub pages
Those GitHub pages are synced with the ReadtheDocs platform and Pull Requests sync up to an index.rst file
The index.rst file, as the extension might imply, is built upon Sphinx and reStructured syntax. (RST stands for reStructured) 
Sphinx and reStructured have their own syntax, formatting and are designed specifically for formatting documentation 
ReStructured Text: 

reStructured is not a full fledged markdown language, but does allow for some customization 

Myriad options for text formatting is available 
images and images with hyperlinks are available 
various themes are available
backgrounds for code snippets like dark mode are available 
Tables, References / Bibliographic citations and a Table of Contents are available 

A POC was performed for ReadtheDocs using the Sphinx tutorial. Was to ensure that certain features that are in the web3 community may be applicable to Hyperledger projects. It was found that features are available but ReadtheDocs relies on third-party plug ins and that deeper / more web3-style layouts would require customization work.
