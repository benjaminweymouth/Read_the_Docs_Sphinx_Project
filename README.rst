A Proof of Concept / Tutorial Page to dive into the customization options and reStructured Syntax for a ReadTheDocs page
=======================================

A GitHub Repo was created for a POC of ReadtheDocs functionality
Linked up Github with ReadtheDocs so that a Pull Request syncs to the documentation page
ReStructured Text Syntax was utilized to test image-based button linking 

See my POC Tutorial here: 

https://read-the-docs-sphinx-project.readthedocs.io/en/latest/?

A POC was performed for ReadtheDocs using the Sphinx tutorial. Was to ensure that certain features that are in the web3 community may be applicable to Hyperledger projects. It was found that features are available but ReadtheDocs relies on third-party plug ins and that deeper / more web3-style layouts would require customization work.
